# Analysis-of-Arctic-Ice-Maps
Analyzed 20+ years of Arctic satellite data (AMSR-E/AMSR2) to visualize sea ice concentration trends. Developed Python scripts using NumPy and Matplotlib to process geospatial data, calculate total ice-covered surface areas, and quantify long-term ice loss between 2004 and 2024.
